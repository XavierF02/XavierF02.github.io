				<h3>M&M's Company Site</h3>
			</a>
			<p>
				M&M's company website serves a couple different functions. The main purpose of the site is to allow customers to buy customizable M&M's for any occasion. In addition to this, you can also locate M&M's stores as well as contact the comapny with any questions you might have.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Contrast:<br>
					This site uses color differently in each section to create great contrast. It is very colorful and engaging without being difficult to read or hard on the eyes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Repetition:<br>
					The repetition in this page is good, each section contains information that you would expect it too. At no point are you confused as to why one section is after another.
				</li>
				<li>
					Alignment:<br>
					The alignment of the website is probably the best part of the whole site besides the color scheme. The way the elements line up both horizontally and vertically make it flow in a great way that leads you from section to section.
				</li>
				<li>
					Proximity:<br>
					Proximity is great all over the site. All products are organized neatly by the occasion, making it very easy to find whatever you are looking for.
				</li>

				<h3>Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</h3>
			</a>
			<p>
				Pacific Northwest X-Ray is a company that sells a large variety of x-ray equipment. Their site is used to display all the products they are selling and give you the information that you need to place an order either over the phone or through email.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Contrast:<br>
					This site has very bad contrast between the background color and the text. The pattern and the color of the background both make it very hard to focus on the actual text of the site.
				</li>
				<li>
					Repetition:<br>
					There is no repetition used on this site. The home page is just comprised of a list of links to different product categories.
				</li>
				<li>
					Alignment:<br>
					The alignment of the page isn't terrible since ther isn't much on the first page. However, the big list of links makes it very difficult to pay attention to anything else on the page.
				</li>
				<li>
					Proximity:<br>
					Proximity is not bad either considering that all the links that you would need are right next to eachother, but this is still a very bad design.
				</li>
