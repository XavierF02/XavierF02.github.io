            <li>Personal background: Hello, my name is Xavier Faulkner. I am a middle child in a family of five. I grew up in Beltsville, Maryland. As a child, I always enjoyed building or fixing anything I could get my hands on. Anything that involved any type of creativity I loved doing. I moved to NC about 9 years ago and I've lived here ever since. I'm currently 19 years old and attending UNCC full time.</li>
            <li>Professional: I got my first job at my uncle's gelato shop a few summers ago. The following school year I got a job at Cici's pizza. My last and most recent job was at Fedex ground as a package handler. However, my goal is to become a software engineer.</li>
            <li>Academic background: In 2016 I started attending an early college called Cabarrus Early College of Technology.

In 2020, I started at UNCC as a junior and am currently attending as a senior with an expected graduation date of May 2022.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I started programming with I was around 12 years old because I wanted to learn how to make games. I taught myself Java by watching Youtube videos and reading articles online. By high school, I was fluent in Java and very comfortable with OOP. This made my programming classes much easier to complete and helped me learn more throughout high school. Today, I am proficient in a few different languages including python, java, C#, C++, and Visual Basic. I am also comfortable with HTML, CSS, and SQL.</li>
